```
1. Title that says "Here is a place to add data".
2. In this field you need to place on which range you were shooting [in meters].
3. Here you need to add how many cm the bullets hit the point of targeting.
4. You need to choose which type of scope you're using
5. Click this button to calculate.

If all was good you should see which correction you need to do.
